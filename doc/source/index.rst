What is OVN Scale Test?
=======================

OVN Scale Test is a plugin of openstack Rally.

OVN Scale Test is intended to provide the community with a OVN control plan
scalability test tool that is capable of performing **specific**,
**complicated** and **reproducible** test cases on **simulated** scenarios.

When something fails, performs slowly or doesn't scale, it's really hard to
answer different questions on "what", "why" and "where" without a solid
scalability testing framework.

For start using this tool, you need to have a
`Rally <https://github.com/openstack/rally>`_ installed, the workflow is also
similar to Rally's.
